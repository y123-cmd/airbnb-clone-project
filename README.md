# AirBnB Clone Project

## Overview
This project is a simplified clone of the AirBnB web application, designed to demonstrate and practice full-stack web development skills. It mimics features like user registration, property listings, and booking.

## Project Goals
- Learn full-stack web development
- Build backend and frontend components from scratch
- Practice version control with Git and GitHub
- Collaborate on a team-based software project

## Tech Stack
- **Backend**: Python, Django
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Database**: MySQL or SQLite
- **Tools**: Git, GitHub, Postman, Ubuntu/Linux CLI

## Team Roles

### Backend Developer
Responsible for building the core functionality of the application, such as handling server-side logic, APIs, authentication, and integrating with the database using frameworks like Django.

### Frontend Developer
Focuses on the user interface and user experience by building responsive layouts using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Ensures users can interact smoothly with the application.

### Database Administrator (DBA)
Designs, implements, and manages the database systems. Ensures data is structured correctly, runs efficiently, and is securely backed up.

### DevOps Engineer
Manages deployment, CI/CD pipelines, and cloud infrastructure. Ensures the application is reliably hosted, monitored, and updated.

### UI/UX Designer
Creates the layout, color scheme, and user flow of the application. Makes sure the app is both visually appealing and user-friendly.

### Project Manager
Coordinates the team, manages timelines, tracks progress, and ensures that project goals are met on time and within scope.

### Quality Assurance (QA) Tester
Tests the application for bugs, usability issues, and performance problems. Makes sure the product meets all requirements before going live.
## Technology Stack

### Django
A high-level Python web framework used to build the backend of the application. It enables fast development and clean design, ideal for building RESTful APIs and handling business logic.

### PostgreSQL
A powerful open-source relational database system used to store and manage user data, listings, bookings, and more. It works seamlessly with Django for efficient data operations.

### HTML/CSS
Used to build and style the frontend pages that users interact with. HTML structures the content, while CSS makes it visually appealing.

### JavaScript
Adds interactivity to the frontend, such as form validation, dynamic page updates, and user interface enhancements.

### Git & GitHub
Used for version control and collaboration. Tracks code changes and allows multiple developers to work on the project simultaneously.

### Postman
A tool for testing and documenting RESTful APIs. Helps ensure that API endpoints function correctly and return the expected data.

### Ubuntu/Linux Terminal
The command line interface used for running scripts, managing the server, setting permissions, and deploying the application.

### Virtual Environments (venv)
Isolates Python packages for the project to prevent conflicts with system-wide packages and dependencies.
